## Name Cleaning Code

This code demonstrates a simple name cleaning process. It reads names from a file, cleans them by capitalizing the first letter of each name and lowercasing the rest, and then writes the cleaned names to a new file. Below is a detailed step-by-step explanation of the process implemented in the code:

### Step 1: Create a file with unclean names

- The script starts by creating a file named `names_raw.txt` and writing unclean names to it. The names are not consistently capitalized.

```python
file = open("names_raw.txt", "w")
file.write("alice\nbob\nCHARLIE\ndavE\n")
file.close()
```

### Step 2: Read names from the file

- Next, the script reads the names from `names_raw.txt` into a list of strings.

```python
file = open("names_raw.txt", "r")
names = file.readlines()
file.close()
```

### Step 3: Clean the names (capitalize properly)

- The script cleans the names by stripping off leading and trailing whitespaces and capitalizing the first letter while lowercasing the rest. The cleaned names are stored in a new list with newline characters appended.

```python
cleaned_names = [name.strip().capitalize() + "\n" for name in names]
```

### Step 4: Write cleaned names to a new file

- The cleaned names are written to a new file named `names_clean.txt`.

```python
file = open("names_clean.txt", "w")
file.writelines(cleaned_names)
file.close()
print("✅ Names cleaned and saved to names_clean.txt")
```

### Step 5: Verify the cleaned names

- Finally, the script reads the cleaned names from `names_clean.txt`, prints them out, and verifies that the cleaning process was successful.

```python
file = open("names_clean.txt", "r")
cleaned_names = file.readlines()
file.close()
print("✅ Cleaned Names:")
for name in cleaned_names:
    print(name.strip())
```

### Output

Expected output:

```
✅ Names cleaned and saved to names_clean.txt
✅ Cleaned Names:
Alice
Bob
Charlie
Dave
```
